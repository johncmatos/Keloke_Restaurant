<h5>5 stars</h5>
<p>I love this restaurant!! Everyone is always so great!!! We loved it so much that we decided to have them cater our babies first birthday party. The food was a success!! All of our guest (friends and family) still talk about how delicious the food was. Thank you for your amazing service!!!</p>

<h4>Lenny</h4>
<h5>5 stars</h5>
<p>This is by far the best Latin Caribbean restaurant in Utah. The food is absolutely delicious! It has brought the true island flavor to Utah. No hint of prepackaged seasonings here. No bland flavor like another supposedly "authentic" restaurant that's much closer to me.</p>

<p>The reviews do not lie. The food was delicious, flavorful, and was just like a perfect home cooked meal. The roasted pork and beef stew were great. As was the moro de guandules and empanadas.</p>
