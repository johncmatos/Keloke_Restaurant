                  <p>This is by far the best Latin Caribbean restaurant in Utah. The food is absolutely delicious! It has brought the true island flavor to Utah. No hint of prepackaged seasonings here. No bland flavor like another supposedly "authentic" restaurant that's much closer to me.</p>

            <p>This was reccommended to me by a Dominican missionary. Is was Sooo yummy! The meat just melted in my mouth and I love the passion fruit juice. Everything was delicious! I didn't realize beans and rice could be so flavorful!</p>
